 ## introduction to design 

  -**4 main thing for having a good design** 
   - Color Theory
   - Typography
   - User Interface Design (UI)
   - User Experience Design (UX)
### color theory 
 - moods of the color
   - `Red`    for Love , Energy and Intensity 
   - `Yellow` for Joy , Intellect and attention
   - `Green`  for Freshness, safty  and growth
   - `Blue`   for stability , trust 
   - `purple` for royality , wealth and feminity 

- of course for building your wesite you dont use only one color! :)

- usually its combining 3 or 4 colors 

## how to know which colors should be combined
- we can use color pallete

- if you choose colors next to each other then its called `analogous colors`.

- **this is good for :**
  - navigation bars 
  - body of the website
  - logo and its background
- **this is not good for :** 
  - something that you want to look `pop`!
- then we can use `complementary colors`

- **Attention**
- where not to use `complementary colors`! :
   -  text colors and text backgrounds !


## user interface design (UI)
   1. Hierachy
      - via size
      - via colors
   2. layout 
   3. Alignment
      - best solutions is to reduce the number of alignment points !
   4. White space 
       - design will look more minimalist and more luxus
    5. Audience

## User Experience (UX) Design
