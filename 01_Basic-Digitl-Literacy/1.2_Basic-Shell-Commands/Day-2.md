## Tip&Tricks

The sub heading to this would be: _Things I wish I was told at the start of the course_.

Take what you want and leave the rest ðŸ™‚

- **Sports**: Set a time, pick something you like and go for it. Our bodies are as important as our brains!
- Get away from the **screen**: Take time in your lunch break and after work to get away from those screens.
- Communication is **more important** than technical skills: Having a safe and open work environment is the most important thing -> learning comes from questions, questions come from trust
- Run **your** race: Everyone learns at their own pace.
- The **internet** is your oyster: Want to deep dive on a niche topics, do it! Want to learn about something related to the topic that we didn't cover, do it! Want to watch a youtube tutorial on what we did to recap and deepen your knowledge.......... do it!
- **Celebrate the little things**: Weather Running our first command, building our first html page or completing reading an article on the best way to use flexbox and grid in combination. Celebrate it. Everyday we are moving forwards, that is worth celebrating.

In the afternoon I will set you up with a small exercise and a good website to further your skills. The website will push you to some things we did not learn, feel free to move at your own pace and remember you can always research and deep dive into any topic we cover, "the internet is your oyster".
