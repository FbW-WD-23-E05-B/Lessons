## Shell

### List off basic terminal commands and what they do:

- man (--help): open the manual on the commands
- cd: takes us to a directory -> change directory
- pwd: print working directory -> show us where we are
- mkdir: makes a new directory
- touch: makes a new file
- mv: moves file to new directory && renames files
- cat: shows us the text content of a file in the terminal
- rm: removes a file or directories (with flags/options)
- nano: editing the file/opening the file
- ls: list all the files and directories
- cp: copying files/directories
- less: read the content of a text file (opens the content in a seperate window && allows us to do more, for example searching and changing pages)
- clear: clear the current terminal (caches the content)
- rmdir: remove directories (empty directories)
- apt: packager manager -> built in with ubuntu
- sudo: super user do -> gives us admin rights

### Will rmdir remove a filled directory?

No, rmdir only works on an empty directory

### What does rm -rf do?

Forcibly removes all files and folders inside a directory/ or just a file.

### What is a markdown file and how is it different from a markup file?

- Light file, structured format
- markup (HTML/XML) -> light version markdown (md)
- easily format text on the web
- common use case is for documenting projects

## Git and Github

### What is Git?

- **version control system**
- Timeline (stages of our work that are trackable) -> version control
- different types of version
- locally - _distributed_

### What is Github?

- A website that hosts git repositories

### What is adding and committing? Is there a difference?

- 3 different workflows
- changes, staging, committing
- after changes you need to add (technically you are always adding)
- then you will commit to the repo
- Both add and commit at the same time 'commit -am ""`
- Difference: git add (staging the file/files that have changes or that you want to stage), git commit (committing your work, saving a timestamp/mark in your git history)

## General (extra)

### Workflow

- we should keep the main clean, make branches and then try to merge those branches with github into the main
- this is a workflow
